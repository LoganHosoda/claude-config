## Custom Commands

### /code-help
**Purpose**: Analyze specific code blocks and provide research-based solutions

**Parameters**:
- File path to analyze
- Explanation of what you're trying to accomplish
- Code block (marked with `// CODE HELP` comment)

**Process**:
1. Inspect the specified file and locate the CODE HELP comment
2. Research potential solutions to the programming challenge
3. Create a new file in `/code-help/` directory with findings
4. Include vim-compatible quickfix format references
5. Provide documentation links and explain why the solution is optimal
6. Leave implementation to the user

**Output Format**:
- Vim quickfix format: `filename:line:column: message`
- Documentation links
- Solution explanation
- Why this approach is best
- Implementation guidance (no actual code changes)

### /new-feature
**Purpose**: Research and provide comprehensive implementation guidance for new features

**Parameters**:
- Feature description and requirements
- Current tech stack context (if not obvious from codebase)
- Target implementation goals

**Process**:
1. Analyze the current codebase structure and tech stack
2. Research best practices and documentation for implementing the requested feature
3. Create a comprehensive research file in `/new-feature/` directory
4. Include relevant documentation links and implementation strategies
5. Provide code examples that follow current project patterns
6. Address security, performance, and maintainability considerations

**Output Format**:
- Feature overview and requirements analysis
- Tech stack compatibility assessment
- Documentation links to official resources
- Implementation strategy with step-by-step guidance
- Code examples following project conventions
- Dependencies and infrastructure requirements
- Testing and validation approach
- Best practices and security considerations

### /new-design
**Purpose**: Generate multiple unique design variations for website components using parallel sub-agents

**Parameters**:
- Design requirements and component type (e.g., "modern navbar with search functionality", "hero section for SaaS landing page", "responsive footer with social links")

**Process**:
1. Analyze existing project structure and design patterns
2. Create `/designs/{component-type}/` directory if it doesn't exist
3. Launch 3 parallel sub-agents to generate unique design variations
4. Each agent creates a complete HTML file with embedded CSS
5. Consider responsive design, accessibility, and modern web standards
6. Generate dynamic file names with timestamps for organization

**Output Format**:
- Three distinct HTML files in `/designs/{component-type}/{timestamp}_variation_{1,2,3}.html`
- Each file contains:
  - Complete HTML structure
  - Embedded CSS with modern styling approaches
  - Responsive design considerations
  - Accessibility features
  - Comments explaining design decisions
  - Documentation links for techniques used

**Design Variations Focus**:
- **Variation 1**: Modern/minimalist approach
- **Variation 2**: Bold/creative approach  
- **Variation 3**: Classic/professional approach
