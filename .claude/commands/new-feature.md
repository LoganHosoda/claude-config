# New Feature Research Directory

This directory contains research findings and implementation guidance for new features analyzed via the `/new-feature` command.

## File Naming Convention
Files are named with timestamp and brief description:
- `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS_feature-name.md`

## File Format
Each new feature research file contains:
- **Feature Overview**: Summary of the requested feature
- **Tech Stack Analysis**: Current technologies and relevant tools
- **Documentation Links**: Official sources and guides for implementation
- **Implementation Strategy**: Recommended approach based on current codebase
- **Code Examples**: Sample implementations following project patterns
- **Best Practices**: Security, performance, and maintainability considerations
- **Dependencies**: Required libraries, tools, or infrastructure changes
- **Testing Strategy**: How to validate the feature works correctly

## Usage
These files serve as comprehensive research and planning documents for implementing new features independently.
